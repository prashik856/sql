# Basic Syntax

In this chapter, we will discuss the Basic Syntax of PL/SQL which is a block-structured language; this means that the PL/SQL programs are divided and written in logical blocks of code. 
Each block consists of three sub-parts −

```
1 	Declarations
This section starts with the keyword DECLARE. It is an optional section and defines all variables, cursors, subprograms, and other elements to be used in the program.

2 	Executable Commands
This section is enclosed between the keywords BEGIN and END and it is a mandatory section. It consists of the executable PL/SQL statements of the program. It should have at least one executable line of code, which may be just a NULL command to indicate that nothing should be executed.

3 	Exception Handling
This section starts with the keyword EXCEPTION. This optional section contains exception(s) that handle errors in the program.
```

Every PL/SQL statement ends with a semicolon (;). 
PL/SQL blocks can be nested within other PL/SQL blocks using BEGIN and END. 
Following is the basic structure of a PL/SQL block −
```sql
DECLARE 
   <declarations section> 
BEGIN 
   <executable command(s)>
EXCEPTION 
   <exception handling> 
END;
```

## The 'Hello World' Example
```sql
DECLARE 
   message  varchar2(20):= 'Hello, World!'; 
BEGIN 
   dbms_output.put_line(message); 
END; 
/ 
```

The end; line signals the end of the PL/SQL block. 
To run the code from the SQL command line, you may need to type / at the beginning of the first blank line after the last line of the code. 
When the above code is executed at the SQL prompt, it produces the following result −

```
Hello World  

PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.
```

## The PL/SQL Identifiers
By default, identifiers are not case-sensitive. 
So you can use integer or INTEGER to represent a numeric value. 
You cannot use a reserved keyword as an identifier.

## The PL/SQL Delimiters
```
+, -, *, / 	Addition, subtraction/negation, multiplication, division
% 	Attribute indicator
' 	Character string delimiter
. 	Component selector
(,) 	Expression or list delimiter
: 	Host variable indicator
, 	Item separator
" 	Quoted identifier delimiter
= 	Relational operator
@ 	Remote access indicator
; 	Statement terminator
:= 	Assignment operator
=> 	Association operator
|| 	Concatenation operator
** 	Exponentiation operator
<<, >> 	Label delimiter (begin and end)
/*, */ 	Multi-line comment delimiter (begin and end)
-- 	Single-line comment indicator
.. 	Range operator
<, >, <=, >= 	Relational operators
<>, '=, ~=, ^= 	Different versions of NOT EQUAL
```

## The PL/SQL Comments
```sql
DECLARE 
   -- variable declaration 
   message  varchar2(20):= 'Hello, World!'; 
BEGIN 
   /* 
   *  PL/SQL executable statement(s) 
   */ 
   dbms_output.put_line(message); 
END; 
/
```

When the above code is executed at the SQL prompt, it produces the following result −
```
Hello World

PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.
```
