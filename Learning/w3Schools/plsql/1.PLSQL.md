# PL SQL
PL/SQL, which stands for Procedural Language extensions to the Structured Query Language (SQL).
It is a combination of SQL along with the procedural features of programming languages.
PL/SQL is one of three key programming languages embedded in the Oracle Database, along with SQL itself and Java.

## Purpose of PL/SQL
The purpose of PL/SQL is to merge database commands with procedural programming language. It offers more complete programming solutions for building critical applications that operate on the Oracle database.

## Features of PL/SQL
PL/SQL has the following features −
```
PL/SQL is tightly integrated with SQL.
It offers extensive extensive error checking mechanisms.
It supports numerous data types for flexible data handling.
Includes a variety of programming structures, such as loops and conditionals. Includes a variety of programming structures, such as loops and conditionals.
It supports structured programming through functions and procedures.
It supports object-oriented programming, enabling more complex data handling and manipulation.
It supports the web application development and server pages.
```

## Why to learn PL/SQL?
Learning PL/SQL is an essential skill for persons who are interested in databases and other advanced RDBMS technologies. 
PL/SQL offers various benefits, making it an essential skill for database developers −
```
Ease of Use: PL/SQL is straightforward to write and read, featuring block-structured syntax which simplifies programming and debugging.

Portability: Programs written in PL/SQL are fully portable across different Oracle databases, ensuring consistency and ease of migration.

Tight SQL Integration: PL/SQL is tightly integrated with SQL, allowing for efficient querying, transforming, and updating of data within a database.

High Performance: It reduces network traffic by sending entire blocks of statements to the database at once, thus improving performance.

Security: It includes robust security features to protect database integrity.

Object-Oriented Support: It supports object-oriented programming, and allows you to define object types that can be used in object-oriented designs.
```

## PL/SQL Block Structured
PL/SQL follows a block-structured approach, dividing programs into logical blocks of code. 
Each block consists of three main sections −
```
Declarations: This section, starting with the keyword DECLARE, is optional and used for defining variables, cursors, subprograms, and other elements required within the block.

Executable Commands: Enclosed between the keywords BEGIN and END, this mandatory section contains executable PL/SQL statements. It must include at least one executable line of code, even if it's just a NULL command indicating no action.

Exception Handling: This starts with the keyword EXCEPTION, this optional section deals with handling errors in the program through defined exceptions.
```

PL/SQL statements are terminated with a semicolon(;). 
Additionally, blocks can be nested within each other using BEGIN and END keywords.

## Applications of PL/SQL
PL/SQL is widely used in various applications, including −
```
Database Security: It implements robust security measures within the database.

XML Management: Generating and managing XML documents within the database.

Linking Databases to Web Pages: Integrates databases with web applications.

Automation: Automating database administration tasks for efficient management.
