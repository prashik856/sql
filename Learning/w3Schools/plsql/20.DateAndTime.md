# Date and Time
In this chapter, we will discuss the Date and Time in PL/SQL. 
There are two classes of date and time related data types in PL/SQL −

```
Datetime data types
Interval data types
```

The Datetime data types are −

```
DATE
TIMESTAMP
TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
TIMESTAMP WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE
```

The Interval data types are −
```
INTERVAL YEAR TO MONTH
INTERVAL DAY TO SECOND
```

## Field Values for Datetime and Interval Data Types
Both datetime and interval data types consist of fields. 
The values of these fields determine the value of the data type. 
The following table lists the fields and their possible values for datetimes and intervals.

```
YEAR 	-4712 to 9999 (excluding year 0) 	Any nonzero integer

MONTH 	01 to 12 	0 to 11

DAY 	01 to 31 (limited by the values of MONTH and YEAR, according to the rules of the calendar for the locale) 	Any nonzero integer

HOUR 	00 to 23 	0 to 23

MINUTE 	00 to 59 	0 to 59

SECOND 	00 to 59.9(n), where 9(n) is the precision of time fractional seconds

The 9(n) portion is not applicable for DATE.
	0 to 59.9(n), where 9(n) is the precision of interval fractional seconds

TIMEZONE_HOUR 	-12 to 14 (range accommodates daylight savings time changes)

Not applicable for DATE or TIMESTAMP.
	Not applicable

TIMEZONE_MINUTE 	00 to 59Not applicable for DATE or TIMESTAMP.	Not applicable

TIMEZONE_REGION 	Not applicable for DATE or TIMESTAMP. 	Not applicable

TIMEZONE_ABBR 	Not applicable for DATE or TIMESTAMP. 	Not applicable
```

## The Datetime Data Types and Functions
Following are the Datetime data types −

```
DATE
It stores date and time information in both character and number datatypes. It is made of information on century, year, month, date, hour, minute, and second. It is specified as −

TIMESTAMP
It is an extension of the DATE data type. It stores the year, month, and day of the DATE datatype, along with hour, minute, and second values. It is useful for storing precise time values.

TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
It is a variant of TIMESTAMP that includes a time zone region name or a time zone offset in its value. The time zone offset is the difference (in hours and minutes) between local time and UTC. This data type is useful for collecting and evaluating date information across geographic regions.

TIMESTAMP WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE
It is another variant of TIMESTAMP that includes a time zone offset in its value.
```

Following table provides the Datetime functions (where, x has the datetime value) −
```
1 	ADD_MONTHS(x, y);
Adds y months to x.

2 	LAST_DAY(x);
Returns the last day of the month.

3 	MONTHS_BETWEEN(x, y);
Returns the number of months between x and y.

4 	NEXT_DAY(x, day);
Returns the datetime of the next day after x.

5 	NEW_TIME;
Returns the time/day value from a time zone specified by the user.

6 	ROUND(x [, unit]);
Rounds x.

7 	SYSDATE();
Returns the current datetime.

8 	TRUNC(x [, unit]);
Truncates x.
```

Timestamp functions (where, x has a timestamp value) −
```
1 	CURRENT_TIMESTAMP();
Returns a TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE containing the current session time along with the session time zone.

2 	EXTRACT({ YEAR | MONTH | DAY | HOUR | MINUTE | SECOND } | { TIMEZONE_HOUR | TIMEZONE_MINUTE } | { TIMEZONE_REGION | } TIMEZONE_ABBR ) FROM x
Extracts and returns a year, month, day, hour, minute, second, or time zone from x.

3 	FROM_TZ(x, time_zone);
Converts the TIMESTAMP x and the time zone specified by time_zone to a TIMESTAMP WITH TIMEZONE.

4 	LOCALTIMESTAMP();
Returns a TIMESTAMP containing the local time in the session time zone.

5 	SYSTIMESTAMP();
Returns a TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE containing the current database time along with the database time zone.

6 	SYS_EXTRACT_UTC(x);
Converts the TIMESTAMP WITH TIMEZONE x to a TIMESTAMP containing the date and time in UTC.

7 	TO_TIMESTAMP(x, [format]);
Converts the string x to a TIMESTAMP.

8 	TO_TIMESTAMP_TZ(x, [format]);
Converts the string x to a TIMESTAMP WITH TIMEZONE.
```

Examples

The following code snippets illustrate the use of the above functions −

Example 1
```sql
SELECT SYSDATE FROM DUAL; 
```

Output −
```
08/31/2012 5:25:34 PM 
```

Example 2
```sql
SELECT TO_CHAR(CURRENT_DATE, 'DD-MM-YYYY HH:MI:SS') FROM DUAL; 
```

Output −
```
31-08-2012 05:26:14
```

Example 3
```sql
SELECT ADD_MONTHS(SYSDATE, 5) FROM DUAL;
```

Output −
```
01/31/2013 5:26:31 PM 
```

Example 4
```sql
SELECT LOCALTIMESTAMP FROM DUAL; 
```

Output −
```
8/31/2012 5:26:55.347000 PM 
```

## The Interval Data Types and Functions
Following are the Interval data types −

```
IINTERVAL YEAR TO MONTH − It stores a period of time using the YEAR and MONTH datetime fields.

INTERVAL DAY TO SECOND − It stores a period of time in terms of days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
```

## Interval Functions
```
1 	NUMTODSINTERVAL(x, interval_unit);
Converts the number x to an INTERVAL DAY TO SECOND.

2 	NUMTOYMINTERVAL(x, interval_unit);
Converts the number x to an INTERVAL YEAR TO MONTH.

3 	TO_DSINTERVAL(x);
Converts the string x to an INTERVAL DAY TO SECOND.

4 	TO_YMINTERVAL(x);
Converts the string x to an INTERVAL YEAR TO MONTH.
```
