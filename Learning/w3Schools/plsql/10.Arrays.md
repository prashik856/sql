# Arrays

The PL/SQL programming language provides a data structure called the VARRAY, which can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type.

A varray is used to store an ordered collection of data, however it is often better to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.

Each element in a varray has an index associated with it. It also has a maximum size that can be changed dynamically.

## Creating a Varray Type
A varray type is created with the CREATE TYPE statement. You must specify the maximum size and the type of elements stored in the varray.

The basic syntax for creating a VARRAY type at the schema level is −
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TYPE varray_type_name IS VARRAY(n) of <element_type>
```
Where,
```
varray_type_name is a valid attribute name,
n is the number of elements (maximum) in the varray,
element_type is the data type of the elements of the array.
```

Maximum size of a varray can be changed using the ALTER TYPE statement.

Example
```sql
CREATE Or REPLACE TYPE namearray AS VARRAY(3) OF VARCHAR2(10); 
/ 

Type created.
```

The basic syntax for creating a VARRAY type within a PL/SQL block is −
```sql
TYPE varray_type_name IS VARRAY(n) of <element_type>
```

For example −
```
TYPE namearray IS VARRAY(5) OF VARCHAR2(10); 
Type grades IS VARRAY(5) OF INTEGER;
```

Example 1:
```sql
DECLARE 
   type namesarray IS VARRAY(5) OF VARCHAR2(10); 
   type grades IS VARRAY(5) OF INTEGER; 
   names namesarray; 
   marks grades; 
   total integer; 
BEGIN 
   names := namesarray('Kavita', 'Pritam', 'Ayan', 'Rishav', 'Aziz'); 
   marks:= grades(98, 97, 78, 87, 92); 
   total := names.count; 
   dbms_output.put_line('Total '|| total || ' Students'); 
   FOR i in 1 .. total LOOP 
      dbms_output.put_line('Student: ' || names(i) || ' 
      Marks: ' || marks(i)); 
   END LOOP; 
END; 
/
```

When the above code is executed at the SQL prompt, it produces the following result −
```
Total 5 Students 
Student: Kavita  Marks: 98 
Student: Pritam  Marks: 97 
Student: Ayan  Marks: 78 
Student: Rishav  Marks: 87 
Student: Aziz  Marks: 92 

PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.

Note: 
- In Oracle environment, the starting index for varrays is always 1.
- You can initialize the varray elements using the constructor method of the varray type, which has the same name as the varray.
- Varrays are one-dimensional arrays.
- A varray is automatically NULL when it is declared and must be initialized before its elements can be referenced.

Example2:
Elements of a varray could also be a %ROWTYPE of any database table or %TYPE of any database table field. The following example illustrates the concept.

We will use the CUSTOMERS table stored in our database as −

Select * from customers;  

+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+ 
| ID | NAME     | AGE | ADDRESS   | SALARY   | 
+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+ 
|  1 | Ramesh   |  32 | Ahmedabad |  2000.00 | 
|  2 | Khilan   |  25 | Delhi     |  1500.00 | 
|  3 | kaushik  |  23 | Kota      |  2000.00 | 
|  4 | Chaitali |  25 | Mumbai    |  6500.00 | 
|  5 | Hardik   |  27 | Bhopal    |  8500.00 | 
|  6 | Komal    |  22 | MP        |  4500.00 | 
+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+ 

```sql
DECLARE 
   CURSOR c_customers is 
   SELECT  name FROM customers; 
   type c_list is varray (6) of customers.name%type; 
   name_list c_list := c_list(); 
   counter integer :=0; 
BEGIN 
   FOR n IN c_customers LOOP 
      counter := counter + 1; 
      name_list.extend; 
      name_list(counter)  := n.name; 
      dbms_output.put_line('Customer('||counter ||'):'||name_list(counter)); 
   END LOOP; 
END; 
/ 
```

When the above code is executed at the SQL prompt, it produces the following result −
```
Customer(1): Ramesh  
Customer(2): Khilan  
Customer(3): kaushik     
Customer(4): Chaitali  
Customer(5): Hardik  
Customer(6): Komal
