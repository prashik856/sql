# Collections

A collection is an ordered group of elements having the same data type. 
Each element is identified by a unique subscript that represents its position in the collection.

PL/SQL provides three collection types −
```
Index-by tables or Associative array
Nested table
Variable-size array or Varray
```

Oracle documentation provides the following characteristics for each type of collections −

```
Collection Type 	Number of Elements 	Subscript Type 	Dense or Sparse 	Where Created 	Can Be Object Type Attribute

Associative array (or index-by table) 	Unbounded 	String or integer 	Either 	Only in PL/SQL block 	No

Nested table 	Unbounded 	Integer 	Starts dense, can become sparse 	Either in PL/SQL block or at schema level 	Yes

Variablesize array (Varray) 	Bounded 	Integer 	Always dense 	Either in PL/SQL block or at schema level 	Yes
```

We have already discussed varray in the chapter 'PL/SQL arrays'. In this chapter, we will discuss the PL/SQL tables.

Both types of PL/SQL tables, i.e., the index-by tables and the nested tables have the same structure and their rows are accessed using the subscript notation. 
However, these two types of tables differ in one aspect; the nested tables can be stored in a database column and the index-by tables cannot.

## Index-By Table
An index-by table (also called an associative array) is a set of key-value pairs. 
Each key is unique and is used to locate the corresponding value. 
The key can be either an integer or a string.

An index-by table is created using the following syntax. 
Here, we are creating an index-by table named table_name, the keys of which will be of the subscript_type and associated values will be of the element_type
```sql
TYPE type_name IS TABLE OF element_type [NOT NULL] INDEX BY subscript_type; 
 
table_name type_name;
```

Example

Following example shows how to create a table to store integer values along with names and later it prints the same list of names.
```sql
DECLARE 
   TYPE salary IS TABLE OF NUMBER INDEX BY VARCHAR2(20); 
   salary_list salary; 
   name   VARCHAR2(20); 
BEGIN 
   -- adding elements to the table 
   salary_list('Rajnish') := 62000; 
   salary_list('Minakshi') := 75000; 
   salary_list('Martin') := 100000; 
   salary_list('James') := 78000;  
   
   -- printing the table 
   name := salary_list.FIRST; 
   WHILE name IS NOT null LOOP 
      dbms_output.put_line 
      ('Salary of ' || name || ' is ' || TO_CHAR(salary_list(name))); 
      name := salary_list.NEXT(name); 
   END LOOP; 
END; 
/
```

When the above code is executed at the SQL prompt, it produces the following result −
```
Salary of James is 78000 
Salary of Martin is 100000 
Salary of Minakshi is 75000 
Salary of Rajnish is 62000

Example

Elements of an index-by table could also be a %ROWTYPE of any database table or %TYPE of any database table field. 
The following example illustrates the concept. 
We will use the CUSTOMERS table stored in our database as −
```
Select * from customers;  
```

+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+ 
| ID | NAME     | AGE | ADDRESS   | SALARY   | 
+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+ 
|  1 | Ramesh   |  32 | Ahmedabad |  2000.00 | 
|  2 | Khilan   |  25 | Delhi     |  1500.00 | 
|  3 | kaushik  |  23 | Kota      |  2000.00 | 
|  4 | Chaitali |  25 | Mumbai    |  6500.00 | 
|  5 | Hardik   |  27 | Bhopal    |  8500.00 | 
|  6 | Komal    |  22 | MP        |  4500.00 | 
+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+  

```sql
DECLARE 
   CURSOR c_customers is 
      select name from customers; 

   TYPE c_list IS TABLE of customers.Name%type INDEX BY binary_integer; 
   name_list c_list; 
   counter integer :=0; 
BEGIN 
   FOR n IN c_customers LOOP 
      counter := counter +1; 
      name_list(counter) := n.name; 
      dbms_output.put_line('Customer('||counter||'):'||name_lis t(counter)); 
   END LOOP; 
END; 
/ 
```

When the above code is executed at the SQL prompt, it produces the following result −
```
Customer(1): Ramesh  
Customer(2): Khilan  
Customer(3): kaushik     
Customer(4): Chaitali  
Customer(5): Hardik  
Customer(6): Komal  

PL/SQL procedure successfully completed
```

## Nested Tables
A nested table is like a one-dimensional array with an arbitrary number of elements. 
However, a nested table differs from an array in the following aspects −
```
An array has a declared number of elements, but a nested table does not. The size of a nested table can increase dynamically.

An array is always dense, i.e., it always has consecutive subscripts. A nested array is dense initially, but it can become sparse when elements are deleted from it.
```

A nested table is created using the following syntax −
```sql
TYPE type_name IS TABLE OF element_type [NOT NULL]; 
 
table_name type_name; 
```

This declaration is similar to the declaration of an index-by table, but there is no INDEX BY clause.

A nested table can be stored in a database column. 
It can further be used for simplifying SQL operations where you join a single-column table with a larger table. 
An associative array cannot be stored in the database.

Example

The following examples illustrate the use of nested table −
```sql
DECLARE 
   TYPE names_table IS TABLE OF VARCHAR2(10); 
   TYPE grades IS TABLE OF INTEGER;  
   names names_table; 
   marks grades; 
   total integer; 
BEGIN 
   names := names_table('Kavita', 'Pritam', 'Ayan', 'Rishav', 'Aziz'); 
   marks:= grades(98, 97, 78, 87, 92); 
   total := names.count; 
   dbms_output.put_line('Total '|| total || ' Students'); 
   FOR i IN 1 .. total LOOP 
      dbms_output.put_line('Student:'||names(i)||', Marks:' || marks(i)); 
   end loop; 
END; 
/  
```

When the above code is executed at the SQL prompt, it produces the following result −
```
Total 5 Students 
Student:Kavita, Marks:98 
Student:Pritam, Marks:97 
Student:Ayan, Marks:78 
Student:Rishav, Marks:87 
Student:Aziz, Marks:92  

PL/SQL procedure successfully completed. 
```

Elements of a nested table can also be a %ROWTYPE of any database table or %TYPE of any database table field. 
The following example illustrates the concept. 
We will use the CUSTOMERS table stored in our database as −
```sql

|  4 | Chaitali |  25 | Mumbai    |  6500.00 | 
|  5 | Hardik   |  27 | Bhopal    |  8500.00 | 
|  6 | Komal    |  22 | MP        |  4500.00 | 
+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+ 

```sql
DECLARE 
   CURSOR c_customers is  
      SELECT  name FROM customers;  
   TYPE c_list IS TABLE of customers.Name%type; 
   name_list c_list := c_list(); 
   counter integer :=0; 
BEGIN 
   FOR n IN c_customers LOOP 
      counter := counter +1; 
      name_list.extend; 
      name_list(counter)  := n.name; 
      dbms_output.put_line('Customer('||counter||'):'||name_list(counter)); 
   END LOOP; 
END; 
/ 
```

When the above code is executed at the SQL prompt, it produces the following result −
```
Customer(1): Ramesh  
Customer(2): Khilan  
Customer(3): kaushik     
Customer(4): Chaitali  
Customer(5): Hardik  
Customer(6): Komal

## Collection Methods
PL/SQL provides the built-in collection methods that make collections easier to use. 
The following table lists the methods and their purpose −
```
1 	EXISTS(n)
Returns TRUE if the nth element in a collection exists; otherwise returns FALSE.

2 	COUNT
Returns the number of elements that a collection currently contains.

3 	LIMIT
Checks the maximum size of a collection.

4 	FIRST
Returns the first (smallest) index numbers in a collection that uses the integer subscripts.

5 	LAST
Returns the last (largest) index numbers in a collection that uses the integer subscripts.

6 	PRIOR(n)
Returns the index number that precedes index n in a collection.

7 	NEXT(n)
Returns the index number that succeeds index n.

8 	EXTEND
Appends one null element to a collection.

9 	EXTEND(n)
Appends n null elements to a collection.

10 	EXTEND(n,i)
Appends n copies of the ith element to a collection.

11 	TRIM
Removes one element from the end of a collection.

12 	TRIM(n)
Removes n elements from the end of a collection.

13 	DELETE
Removes all elements from a collection, setting COUNT to 0.

14 	DELETE(n)
Removes the nth element from an associative array with a numeric key or a nested table. If the associative array has a string key, the element corresponding to the key value is deleted. If n is null, DELETE(n) does nothing.

15 	DELETE(m,n)
Removes all elements in the range m..n from an associative array or nested table. If m is larger than n or if m or n is null, DELETE(m,n) does nothing.
```

## Collection Exceptions
The following table provides the collection exceptions and when they are raised −
```
COLLECTION_IS_NULL 	You try to operate on an atomically null collection.

NO_DATA_FOUND 	A subscript designates an element that was deleted, or a nonexistent element of an associative array.

SUBSCRIPT_BEYOND_COUNT 	A subscript exceeds the number of elements in a collection.

SUBSCRIPT_OUTSIDE_LIMIT 	A subscript is outside the allowed range.

VALUE_ERROR 	A subscript is null or not convertible to the key type. This exception might occur if the key is defined as a PLS_INTEGER range, and the subscript is outside this range.
```
