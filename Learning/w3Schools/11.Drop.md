# Drop

## Drop Database
The SQL DROP DATABASE Statement

The DROP DATABASE statement is used to drop an existing SQL database.

Syntax
```sql
DROP DATABASE databasename; 
```

Be careful before dropping a database. Deleting a database will result in loss of complete information stored in the database!

DROP DATABASE Example
The following SQL statement drops the existing database "testDB":
```sql
DROP DATABASE testDB;
```

Make sure you have admin privilege before dropping any database. Once a database is dropped, you can check it in the list of databases with the following SQL command: SHOW DATABASES;
