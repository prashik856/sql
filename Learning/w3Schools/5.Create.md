## PROCEDURE
SQL Stored Procedures for SQL Server

What is a Stored Procedure?
- A stored procedure is a prepared SQL code that you can save, so the code can be reused over and over again

- So if you have an SQL query that you write over and over again, save it as a stored procedure, and then just call it to execute it.

- You can also pass parameters to a stored procedure, so that the stored procedure can act based on the parameter value(s) that is passed.


Stored Procedure Syntax
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name
AS
sql_statement
GO; 
```

Execute a Stored Procedure
```sql
EXEC procedure_name; 
```

The following SQL statement creates a stored procedure named "SelectAllCustomers" that selects all records from the "Customers" table:
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE SelectAllCustomers
AS
SELECT * FROM Customers
GO;
```

Execute the stored procedure above as follows:
```sql
EXEC SelectAllCustomers;
```

### Stored Procedure With One Parameter
The following SQL statement creates a stored procedure that selects Customers from a particular City from the "Customers" table:
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE SelectAllCustomers @City nvarchar(30)
AS
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City = @City
GO;
```

Execute the stored procedure above as follows:
```sql
EXEC SelectAllCustomers @City = 'London'; 
```

### Stored Procedure With Multiple Parameters
Setting up multiple parameters is very easy. Just list each parameter and the data type separated by a comma as shown below.

The following SQL statement creates a stored procedure that selects Customers from a particular City with a particular PostalCode from the "Customers" table:
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE SelectAllCustomers @City nvarchar(30), @PostalCode nvarchar(10)
AS
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City = @City AND PostalCode = @PostalCode
GO;
```

Execute the stored procedure above as follows:
```sql
EXEC SelectAllCustomers @City = 'London', @PostalCode = 'WA1 1DP'; 
```


## CREATE DATABASE
The SQL CREATE DATABASE Statement

The CREATE DATABASE statement is used to create a new SQL database.

Syntax
```sql
CREATE DATABASE databasename; 
```

CREATE DATABASE Example

The following SQL statement creates a database called "testDB":
```sql
CREATE DATABASE testDB;
```

Make sure you have admin privilege before creating any database. Once a database is created, you can check it in the list of databases with the following SQL command: SHOW DATABASES;
