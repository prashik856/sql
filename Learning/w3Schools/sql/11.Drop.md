# Drop

## Drop Database
The SQL DROP DATABASE Statement

The DROP DATABASE statement is used to drop an existing SQL database.

Syntax
```sql
DROP DATABASE databasename; 
```

Be careful before dropping a database. Deleting a database will result in loss of complete information stored in the database!

DROP DATABASE Example
The following SQL statement drops the existing database "testDB":
```sql
DROP DATABASE testDB;
```

Make sure you have admin privilege before dropping any database. Once a database is dropped, you can check it in the list of databases with the following SQL command: SHOW DATABASES;

## DROP INDEX Statement
The DROP INDEX statement is used to delete an index in a table.

MS Access:
```sql
DROP INDEX index_name ON table_name; 
```

SQL Server:
```sql
DROP INDEX table_name.index_name; 
```

DB2/Oracle:
```sql
DROP INDEX index_name; 
```

MySQL:
```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP INDEX index_name; 
```
