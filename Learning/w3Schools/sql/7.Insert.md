# Insert statement
The Insert Into statement is used to insert new records in a table

Syntax
```sql
insert into table_name 
(column1, column2, column3, ...)
values (value1, value2, value3, ...);
```

for adding all the values
```sql
insert into table_name
values (value1, value2, value3, ...);
```

Insert into example
```sql
insert into customers 
(customername, contactname, address, city,
 postalcode, country)
 values ('Cardinal', 'Tom B. Erichsen', 'Skagen 21', 
         'Stavanger', '4006', 'Norway');
```

Insert data only in Specified columns. Empty values will be stored as null.
```sql
insert into customers (customername, city, country)
values ('Cardinal', 'Stavanger', 'Norway');
```


## INSERT INTO SELECT
The INSERT INTO SELECT statement copies data from one table and inserts it into another table.

The INSERT INTO SELECT statement requires that the data types in source and target tables match.

The existing records in the target table are unaffected.

INSERT INTO SELECT Syntax
```sql
// Copy all columns from one table to another table:
INSERT INTO table2
SELECT * FROM table1
WHERE condition; 
```

Copy only some columns from one table into another table:
```sql
INSERT INTO table2 (column1, column2, column3, ...)
SELECT column1, column2, column3, ...
FROM table1
WHERE condition; 
```

SQL INSERT INTO SELECT Examples

Copy "Suppliers" into "Customers" (the columns that are not filled with data, will contain NULL):
```sql
INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, City, Country)
SELECT SupplierName, City, Country FROM Suppliers;
```

Copy "Suppliers" into "Customers" (fill all columns):
```sql
INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country)
SELECT SupplierName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country FROM Suppliers;
```

Copy only the German suppliers into "Customers":
```sql
INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, City, Country)
SELECT SupplierName, City, Country FROM Suppliers
WHERE Country='Germany';
```
