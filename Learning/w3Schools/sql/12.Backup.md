# Backup

## The SQL BACKUP DATABASE Statement

The BACKUP DATABASE statement is used in SQL Server to create a full back up of an existing SQL database.

Syntax:
```sql
BACKUP DATABASE databasename
TO DISK = 'filepath'; 
```

### The SQL BACKUP WITH DIFFERENTIAL Statement
A differential back up only backs up the parts of the database that have changed since the last full database backup.

Syntax:
```sql
BACKUP DATABASE databasename
TO DISK = 'filepath'
WITH DIFFERENTIAL; 
```

### BACKUP DATABASE Example
The following SQL statement creates a full back up of the existing database "testDB" to the D disk:
```sql
BACKUP DATABASE testDB
TO DISK = 'D:\backups\testDB.bak';
```

Always back up the database to a different drive than the actual database. Then, if you get a disk crash, you will not lose your backup file along with the database.

### BACKUP WITH DIFFERENTIAL Example
The following SQL statement creates a differential back up of the database "testDB":
```sql
BACKUP DATABASE testDB
TO DISK = 'D:\backups\testDB.bak'
WITH DIFFERENTIAL; 
```

A differential back up reduces the back up time (since only the changes are backed up).
