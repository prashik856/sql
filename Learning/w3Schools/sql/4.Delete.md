# Delete Statement
delete statement is used to delete existing records in a table.

Delete syntax
```sql
delete from table_name where condition;
```
Be very careful when deleting records in a table.
the where clause specifies which records to delete.
if we omit where clause, all the records will be deleted.

Example
```sql
delete from customers where
customername='Alfreds Futterkiste';
```

## Delete All records
```sql
delete from table_name;
delete from customers;
```
delete all rows without deleting the table.
