# Select Clause
The continuation of the select clause

## EXISTS OPERATOR
The EXISTS operator is used to test for the existence of any record in a subquery.

The EXISTS operator returns TRUE if the subquery returns one or more records.

EXISTS Syntax
```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE EXISTS
(SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition); 
```

The following SQL statement returns TRUE and lists the suppliers with a product price less than 20:
```sql
SELECT SupplierName
FROM Suppliers
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT ProductName FROM Products WHERE Products.SupplierID = Suppliers.supplierID AND Price < 20);
```

The following SQL statement returns TRUE and lists the suppliers with a product price equal to 22:
```sql
SELECT SupplierName
FROM Suppliers
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT ProductName FROM Products WHERE Products.SupplierID = Suppliers.supplierID AND Price = 22); 
```

## ANY AND ALL OPERATORS
The ANY and ALL operators allow you to perform a comparison between a single column value and a range of other values.

### Any Operator
The ANY operator:
- returns a boolean value as a result
- returns TRUE if ANY of the subquery values meet the condition

ANY means that the condition will be true if the operation is true for any of the values in the range.

ANY Syntax
```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name operator ANY
  (SELECT column_name
  FROM table_name
  WHERE condition); 
// The operator must be a standard comparison operator (=, <>, !=, >, >=, <, or <=).
```

### All Operator
The ALL operator:

- returns a boolean value as a result
- returns TRUE if ALL of the subquery values meet the condition
- is used with SELECT, WHERE and HAVING statements

ALL means that the condition will be true only if the operation is true for all values in the range. 

ALL Syntax With SELECT
```sql
SELECT ALL column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition; 
```

ALL Syntax With WHERE or HAVING
```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name operator ALL
  (SELECT column_name
  FROM table_name
  WHERE condition); 
// The operator must be a standard comparison operator (=, <>, !=, >, >=, <, or <=).
```

The following SQL statement lists the ProductName if it finds ANY records in the OrderDetails table has Quantity equal to 10 (this will return TRUE because the Quantity column has some values of 10):
```sql
SELECT ProductName
FROM Products
WHERE ProductID = ANY
  (SELECT ProductID
  FROM OrderDetails
  WHERE Quantity = 10); 
```

The following SQL statement lists the ProductName if it finds ANY records in the OrderDetails table has Quantity larger than 99 (this will return TRUE because the Quantity column has some values larger than 99):
```sql
SELECT ProductName
FROM Products
WHERE ProductID = ANY
  (SELECT ProductID
  FROM OrderDetails
  WHERE Quantity > 99); 
```

The following SQL statement lists the ProductName if it finds ANY records in the OrderDetails table has Quantity larger than 1000 (this will return FALSE because the Quantity column has no values larger than 1000):
```sql
SELECT ProductName
FROM Products
WHERE ProductID = ANY
  (SELECT ProductID
  FROM OrderDetails
  WHERE Quantity > 1000); 
```

The following SQL statement lists ALL the product names:
```sql
SELECT ALL ProductName
FROM Products
WHERE TRUE; 
```

The following SQL statement lists the ProductName if ALL the records in the OrderDetails table has Quantity equal to 10. This will of course return FALSE because the Quantity column has many different values (not only the value of 10):
```sql
SELECT ProductName
FROM Products
WHERE ProductID = ALL
  (SELECT ProductID
  FROM OrderDetails
  WHERE Quantity = 10);
```
