# SQL Introduction

Structured Query Language.

SQL can do CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations on database.
It can also set permissions on tables, procedures, and views

# RDBMS
Relational Database Management System.

data is stored in database objects called tables.
Tables consist of columns and rows.

```sql
select * form customers;
```
Fields are columns of the table.
Records are the rows of the table.

# Semicolon after SQL statements
Some database systems require a semicolon at the end of each of each sql statement.

# Most Important SQL Commands
Here:
- select
- update
- delete
- insert into
- create database
- alter database
- create table
- alter table
- drop table
- create index (search key)
- drop index

SQL keywords are not cases sensitive.
select is same as SELECT.

# SQL Dates
The most difficult part when working with dates is to be sure that the format of the date you are trying to insert, matches the format of the date column in the database.

As long as your data contains only the date portion, your queries will work as expected. However, if a time portion is involved, it gets more complicated.

## SQL Date Data Types
MySQL comes with the following data types for storing a date or a date/time value in the database:
- DATE - format YYYY-MM-DD
- DATETIME - format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS
- TIMESTAMP - format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS
- YEAR - format YYYY or YY

SQL Server comes with the following data types for storing a date or a date/time value in the database:
- DATE - format YYYY-MM-DD
- DATETIME - format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS
- SMALLDATETIME - format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS
- TIMESTAMP - format: a unique number

The date types are chosen for a column when you create a new table in your database!

## SQL Working with Dates
Look at the following table:

```
OrderId 	ProductName 	OrderDate
1 	Geitost 	2008-11-11
2 	Camembert Pierrot 	2008-11-09
3 	Mozzarella di Giovanni 	2008-11-11
4 	Mascarpone Fabioli 	2008-10-29
```

Now we want to select the records with an OrderDate of "2008-11-11" from the table above.

We use the following SELECT statement:
```sql
 SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE OrderDate='2008-11-11'
```

The result-set will look like this:
```
OrderId 	ProductName 	OrderDate
1 	Geitost 	2008-11-11
3 	Mozzarella di Giovanni 	2008-11-11
```

Two dates can easily be compared if there is no time component involved!

Now, assume that the "Orders" table looks like this (notice the added time-component in the "OrderDate" column):

```
OrderId 	ProductName 	OrderDate
1 	Geitost 	2008-11-11 13:23:44
2 	Camembert Pierrot 	2008-11-09 15:45:21
3 	Mozzarella di Giovanni 	2008-11-11 11:12:01
4 	Mascarpone Fabioli 	2008-10-29 14:56:59
```

If we use the same SELECT statement as above:
```sql
 SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE OrderDate='2008-11-11'
```

we will get no result! This is because the query is looking only for dates with no time portion.

To keep your queries simple and easy to maintain, do not use time-components in your dates, unless you have to!

# SQL Injection

## SQL Injection
SQL injection is a code injection technique that might destroy your database.

SQL injection is one of the most common web hacking techniques.

SQL injection is the placement of malicious code in SQL statements, via web page input.

## SQL in Web Pages
SQL injection usually occurs when you ask a user for input, like their username/userid, and instead of a name/id, the user gives you an SQL statement that you will unknowingly run on your database.

Look at the following example which creates a SELECT statement by adding a variable (txtUserId) to a select string. The variable is fetched from user input (getRequestString):

```
txtUserId = getRequestString("UserId");
txtSQL = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = " + txtUserId;
```

The rest of this chapter describes the potential dangers of using user input in SQL statements.

## SQL Injection Based on 1=1 is Always True
ook at the example above again. The original purpose of the code was to create an SQL statement to select a user, with a given user id.

If there is nothing to prevent a user from entering "wrong" input, the user can enter some "smart" input like this:

UserId: 105 OR 1=1

Then, the SQL statement will look like this:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = 105 OR 1=1; 
```

The SQL above is valid and will return ALL rows from the "Users" table, since OR 1=1 is always TRUE.

Does the example above look dangerous? What if the "Users" table contains names and passwords?

The SQL statement above is much the same as this:
```sql
SELECT UserId, Name, Password FROM Users WHERE UserId = 105 or 1=1; 
```

A hacker might get access to all the user names and passwords in a database, by simply inserting 105 OR 1=1 into the input field.

## SQL Injection Based on ""="" is Always True
Here is an example of a user login on a web site:

Username: John Doe

Password: myPass

```
uName = getRequestString("username");
uPass = getRequestString("userpassword");

sql = 'SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Name ="' + uName + '" AND Pass ="' + uPass + '"'
```

```sql
 SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Name ="John Doe" AND Pass ="myPass" 
```

A hacker might get access to user names and passwords in a database by simply inserting " OR ""=" into the user name or password text box:

User Name: " or ""="

Password: " or ""="

The code at the server will create a valid SQL statement like this:
```sql
 SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Name ="" or ""="" AND Pass ="" or ""="" 
```

The SQL above is valid and will return all rows from the "Users" table, since OR ""="" is always TRUE.

## SQL Injection Based on Batched SQL Statements 
Most databases support batched SQL statement.

A batch of SQL statements is a group of two or more SQL statements, separated by semicolons.

The SQL statement below will return all rows from the "Users" table, then delete the "Suppliers" table.

```sql
SELECT * FROM Users; DROP TABLE Suppliers 
```

Look at the following example: 
```sql
txtUserId = getRequestString("UserId");
txtSQL = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = " + txtUserId;
```

And the following input:

User id: 105; DROP TABLE Suppliers

The valid SQL statement would look like this:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = 105; DROP TABLE Suppliers; 
```

## Use SQL Parameters for Protection
To protect a web site from SQL injection, you can use SQL parameters.

SQL parameters are values that are added to an SQL query at execution time, in a controlled manner.

```
txtUserId = getRequestString("UserId");
txtSQL = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = @0";
db.Execute(txtSQL,txtUserId);
```

Note that parameters are represented in the SQL statement by a @ marker.

The SQL engine checks each parameter to ensure that it is correct for its column and are treated literally, and not as part of the SQL to be executed.

```
txtNam = getRequestString("CustomerName");
txtAdd = getRequestString("Address");
txtCit = getRequestString("City");
txtSQL = "INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName,Address,City) Values(@0,@1,@2)";
db.Execute(txtSQL,txtNam,txtAdd,txtCit);
```

## Examples
The following examples shows how to build parameterized queries in some common web languages.

SELECT STATEMENT IN ASP.NET:
```
txtUserId = getRequestString("UserId");
sql = "SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE CustomerId = @0";
command = new SqlCommand(sql);
command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@0",txtUserId);
command.ExecuteReader();
```

INSERT INTO STATEMENT IN ASP.NET:
```
txtNam = getRequestString("CustomerName");
txtAdd = getRequestString("Address");
txtCit = getRequestString("City");
txtSQL = "INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName,Address,City) Values(@0,@1,@2)";
command = new SqlCommand(txtSQL);
command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@0",txtNam);
command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@1",txtAdd);
command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@2",txtCit);
command.ExecuteNonQuery();
```

INSERT INTO STATEMENT IN PHP:
```
$stmt = $dbh->prepare("INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName,Address,City)
VALUES (:nam, :add, :cit)");
$stmt->bindParam(':nam', $txtNam);
$stmt->bindParam(':add', $txtAdd);
$stmt->bindParam(':cit', $txtCit);
$stmt->execute();
```

# SQL Hosting

## SQL Hosting
If you want your web site to be able to store and retrieve data from a database, your web server should have access to a database-system that uses the SQL language.

If your web server is hosted by an Internet Service Provider (ISP), you will have to look for SQL hosting plans.

The most common SQL hosting databases are MS SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, and MS Access.


## MS SQL Server
Microsoft's SQL Server is a popular database software for database-driven web sites with high traffic.

SQL Server is a very powerful, robust and full featured SQL database system.

## Oracle
Oracle is also a popular database software for database-driven web sites with high traffic.

Oracle is a very powerful, robust and full featured SQL database system.

## MySQL
MySQL is also a popular database software for web sites.

MySQL is a very powerful, robust and full featured SQL database system.

MySQL is an inexpensive alternative to the expensive Microsoft and Oracle solutions.

## MS Access
When a web site requires only a simple database, Microsoft Access can be a solution.

MS Access is not well suited for very high-traffic, and not as powerful as MySQL, SQL Server, or Oracle.

# SQL Data Types for MySQL, SQL Server, and MS Access

The data type of a column defines what value the column can hold: integer, character, money, date and time, binary, and so on.

## SQL Data Types

Each column in a database table is required to have a name and a data type.

An SQL developer must decide what type of data that will be stored inside each column when creating a table. The data type is a guideline for SQL to understand what type of data is expected inside of each column, and it also identifies how SQL will interact with the stored data.

Data types might have different names in different database. And even if the name is the same, the size and other details may be different

## MySQL Data Types (Version 8.0)
In MySQL there are three main data types: string, numeric, and date and time.

### String Data Types
```
Data type 	                    Description
CHAR(size) 	                    A FIXED length string (can contain letters, numbers, and special characters). The size parameter specifies the column length in characters - can be from 0 to 255. Default is 1
VARCHAR(size) 	                A VARIABLE length string (can contain letters, numbers, and special characters). The size parameter specifies the maximum string length in characters - can be from 0 to 65535
BINARY(size) 	                Equal to CHAR(), but stores binary byte strings. The size parameter specifies the column length in bytes. Default is 1
VARBINARY(size) 	            Equal to VARCHAR(), but stores binary byte strings. The size parameter specifies the maximum column length in bytes.
TINYBLOB 	                    For BLOBs (Binary Large Objects). Max length: 255 bytes
TINYTEXT 	                    Holds a string with a maximum length of 255 characters
TEXT(size) 	                    Holds a string with a maximum length of 65,535 bytes

LONGBLOB 	                    For BLOBs (Binary Large Objects). Holds up to 4,294,967,295 bytes of data
ENUM(val1, val2, val3, ...) 	A string object that can have only one value, chosen from a list of possible values. You can list up to 65535 values in an ENUM list. If a value is inserted that is not in the list, a blank value will be inserted. The values are sorted in the order you enter them
SET(val1, val2, val3, ...) 	    A string object that can have 0 or more values, chosen from a list of possible values. You can list up to 64 values in a SET list
```

### Numeric Data Types
```
Data type 	                Description
BIT(size) 	                A bit-value type. The number of bits per value is specified in size. The size parameter can hold a value from 1 to 64. The default value for size is 1.
TINYINT(size) 	            A very small integer. Signed range is from -128 to 127. Unsigned range is from 0 to 255. The size parameter specifies the maximum display width (which is 255)
BOOL 	                    Zero is considered as false, nonzero values are considered as true.
BOOLEAN 	                Equal to BOOL
SMALLINT(size) 	            A small integer. Signed range is from -32768 to 32767. Unsigned range is from 0 to 65535. The size parameter specifies the maximum display width (which is 255)
MEDIUMINT(size) 	        A medium integer. Signed range is from -8388608 to 8388607. Unsigned range is from 0 to 16777215. The size parameter specifies the maximum display width (which is 255)
INT(size) 	                A medium integer. Signed range is from -2147483648 to 2147483647. Unsigned range is from 0 to 4294967295. The size parameter specifies the maximum display width (which is 255)
INTEGER(size) 	            Equal to INT(size)
BIGINT(size) 	            A large integer. Signed range is from -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807. Unsigned range is from 0 to 18446744073709551615. The size parameter specifies the maximum display width (which is 255)
FLOAT(size, d) 	            A floating point number. The total number of digits is specified in size. The number of digits after the decimal point is specified in the d parameter. This syntax is deprecated in MySQL 8.0.17, and it will be removed in future MySQL versions
FLOAT(p) 	                A floating point number. MySQL uses the p value to determine whether to use FLOAT or DOUBLE for the resulting data type. If p is from 0 to 24, the data type becomes FLOAT(). If p is from 25 to 53, the data type becomes DOUBLE()
DOUBLE(size, d) 	        A normal-size floating point number. The total number of digits is specified in size. The number of digits after the decimal point is specified in the d parameter
DOUBLE PRECISION(size, d) 	 
DECIMAL(size, d) 	        An exact fixed-point number. The total number of digits is specified in size. The number of digits after the decimal point is specified in the d parameter. The maximum number for size is 65. The maximum number for d is 30. The default value for size is 10. The default value for d is 0.
DEC(size, d) 	            Equal to DECIMAL(size,d)
```

All the numeric data types may have an extra option: UNSIGNED or ZEROFILL. If you add the UNSIGNED option, MySQL disallows negative values for the column. If you add the ZEROFILL option, MySQL automatically also adds the UNSIGNED attribute to the column.

### Date and Time Data Types
```

TIMESTAMP(fsp) 	A timestamp. TIMESTAMP values are stored as the number of seconds since the Unix epoch ('1970-01-01 00:00:00' UTC). Format: YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss. The supported range is from '1970-01-01 00:00:01' UTC to '2038-01-09 03:14:07' UTC. Automatic initialization and updating to the current date and time can be specified using DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP and ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP in the column definition
TIME(fsp) 	    A time. Format: hh:mm:ss. The supported range is from '-838:59:59' to '838:59:59'
YEAR 	        A year in four-digit format. Values allowed in four-digit format: 1901 to 2155, and 0000.
