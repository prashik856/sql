# Select Statement

Used to select data from a database
```sql
select * from Customers;
```

## Syntax
```sql
select column1, colum2, ... from table_name;
```
columns are filed names.
If we want all fields

```sql
select * from table_name;
```

## Select Column
```sql
select customername, city from customers;
select * from customers;
```

## Distinct statement
Return only distinct (different) values.
```sql
select distinct column1, column2, ... from table_name;
select Country from Customers;
select distinct country from customers;
```

## Distinct Count
```sql
select count(distinct Country) from customers;
/*
The above query might not work in Microsoft access db.
*/
select count(*) as distincyCountries from ( select distinct Country from Customers);
```

## Where Clause
Where clause is used to filter records.
```sql
select column1, column2, ...
from table_name
where condition;
```
Where clause is also used in Update and Delete, etc.

```sql
select * from customers where country='Mexico';
```
For text vs numeric fields
```sql
select * from customers where customerid=1;
```

Operators in where clause
```sql
/*
= Equal
> Greater than
< Less than
>= Greater than or equal
<= Less than or equal
<> Not equal. In some versions, we have != as not equal
between - between a certain range
like - search for pattern
in - to specify multiple possible values for a column
*/
```

## AND, OR and NOT Operators
Where clause can be combined with AND, OR and NOT Operators.
AND - all are true
OR - any one of them is true
NOT - not true

And syntax
```sql
select column1, column2, ...
from table_name
where condition1 and condition2 and condition3 ...;
```

OR syntax
```sql
select column1, column2, ...
from table_name
where condition1 or condition2 or condition3 ...;
```

Not syntax
```sql
select column1, column2, ...
from table_name
where not condition;
```

Examples:
```sql
select * from customers 
where country='Germany' AND City='Berlin';

select * from Customers where City='Berlin' or City='Munchen';

select * from Customers where Country='Germany' or Country='Spain';

select * from customers where not country='Germany';
```

Combining and, or and not
```sql
select * from customers 
where country='Germany' and 
      (City='Berlin' or city='Muchen');

select * from customers 
         where not country='Germany' 
           and not country='usa';
```

## Order keyword
order by is used to sort the result-set.
desc keyword is used for decending and asc is used for ascending order.

```sql
select column1, column2, ...
from table_name
order by column1, column2, ...
ASC|DESC;
```

Order by example
```sql
select * from customers order by country;

select * from customers order by country desc;
```

Order by several columns. First column takes preference.
```sql
select * from customers
order by country, customername;
```

Sorted ascending by country, and descending by customername
```sql
select * from customers
order by country asc, customername desc;
```

## Null values
Null values ia field with no value.
How to test null values? We use these

is null syntax
```sql
select column_names 
from table_name
where column_name is null;
```

is not null syntax
```sql
select column_names
from table_name
where column_name is not null;
```

The is null Operator. Used to test for empty values (null values)
```sql
select customername, contactname, address 
from customers 
where address is null;
```
Always use is null to look for null values.

The is no null operator, used to test for non-empty values.
```sql
select customername, contactname, address
from customers 
where address is not null;
```

## TOP, LIMIT, FETCH FIRST OR ROWNUM Clause
select top clause is used to specify the number of records to return.
Useful in large tables with thousands of records.

Not all databases supports *select top* clause.
Mysql supports limit clause.
Oracle uses *Fetch First n rows only* and *Rownum*

SQL Server/MS Access Syntax:
```sql
select top number|percent
column_name(s)
from table_name
where condition;
```

MySQL Syntax:
```sql
select column_names(s)
from table_name
where condition
limit number;
```

Oracle 12 Syntax:
```sql
select column_name(s)
from table_name
order by column_name(s)
fetch first number rows only;
```

Older Oracle Syntax
```sql
select column_name(s)
from table_name
where rownum <= number;
```

Older Oracle Syntax (with Order by)
```sql
from (select column_name(s) 
    from table_name order by column_name(s))
where rownum <= number;
```

Examples
```sql
select top 3 * from customers;

// mysql equivalent
select * from customers limit 3;

// Oracle equivalent
select * from customers fetch first 3 rows only;
```

Top percent example. for sql server/ms access
```sql
select top 50 percent * from customers;

// Oracle
select * from customers fetch first 50 percent rows only;
```

Add a where clause
```sql
select top 3 * from customers where country='Germany';

// mysql equivalent
select * from customers where country='Germany' limit 3;

// Oracle
select * from customers where country = 'Germany'
fetch first 3 rows only;
```

## Min Max
Min - returns smallest value of selected column
Max - returns max value of selected column

Syntax
```sql
select MIN(column_name) from table_name where condition;

select MAX(column_name) from table_name where condition;
```

Example
```sql
// min example
select min(Price) as SmallestPrice from Products;

// max example
select max(Price) as LargestPrice from Products;
```

## Count, Avg, sum
Count - returns number of rows that matches a specified criterion
avg - returns average value of numeric column
sum - returns total sum of numeric column

Syntax
```sql
// count
select count(column_name) from table_name where condition;

// avg
select avg(column_name) from table_name where condition;

// sum
select sum(column_name) from table_name where condition;
```

Examples
```sql
// Null values are not counted in count
select count(ProuctId) from Products

// null values are ignored
select avg(Price) from products;

// null values are ignored
select sum(quality) from Orderdetails;
```

## Like Operator
Used in where clause to search for specific pattern in column.

There are two wildcards often used in conjunction with the LIKE operator:
- The percent sign (%) represents zero, one, or multiple characters
- The underscore sign (_) represents one, single character

NOTE: MS Access uses an asterisk (*) instead of the percent sign (%), and a question mark (?) instead of the underscore (_).

Syntax
```sql
// like
select column1, column2, ... from table_name where columnN like pattern;

// Combine any number of conditions using AND or OR operators
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%'	Finds any values that start with "a"
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%a'	Finds any values that end with "a"
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%or%'	Finds any values that have "or" in any position
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '_r%'	Finds any values that have "r" in the second position
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a_%'	Finds any values that start with "a" and are at least 2 characters in length
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a__%'	Finds any values that start with "a" and are at least 3 characters in length
WHERE ContactName LIKE 'a%o'	Finds any values that start with "a" and ends with "o"
```

EXAMPLES:
```sql
// STARTS WITH a
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%';

// ends with a
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%a';

// has or in it
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%or%';

// Customer that has r in 2nd position
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '_r%';

// Customer that starts with a, and has atleast 3 letters
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a__%';

// Customer that starts with a and ends with o
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE ContactName LIKE 'a%o';

// Customer that does not starts with a
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName NOT LIKE 'a%';
```

## Wildcards
A wildcard character is used to substitute one or more characters 
in a string.
Wildcard characters are used with the LIKE operator. 
The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.

Wildcard Characters in MS Access
```
Symbol	Description	                                                Example
*	    Represents zero or more characters	                        bl* finds bl, black, blue, and blob
?	    Represents a single character	                            h?t finds hot, hat, and hit
[]	    Represents any single character within the brackets	        h[oa]t finds hot and hat, but not hit
!	    Represents any character not in the brackets	            h[!oa]t finds hit, but not hot and hat
-	    Represents any single character within the specified range	c[a-b]t finds cat and cbt
#	    Represents any single numeric character	                    2#5 finds 205, 215, 225, 235, 245, 255, 265, 275, 285, and 295
```

Wildcard Characters in SQL Server
```
Symbol	Description	                                                Example
%	    Represents zero or more characters	                        bl% finds bl, black, blue, and blob
_	    Represents a single character	                            h_t finds hot, hat, and hit
[]	    Represents any single character within the brackets	        h[oa]t finds hot and hat, but not hit
^	    Represents any character not in the brackets	            h[^oa]t finds hit, but not hot and hat
-	    Represents any single character within the specified range	c[a-b]t finds cat and cbt
```

Examples using like
```sql

LIKE Operator	                Description
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%'	Finds any values that starts with "a"
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%a'	Finds any values that ends with "a"
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%or%'	Finds any values that have "or" in any position
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '_r%'	Finds any values that have "r" in the second position
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a__%'	Finds any values that starts with "a" and are at least 3 characters in length
WHERE ContactName LIKE 'a%o'	Finds any values that starts with "a" and ends with "o"
```

Examples of wildcard
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE 'ber%';

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE '%es%';

// Starts with any character but ends with ondon
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE '_ondon';

// _ is single character wildcard
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE 'L_n_on';

// all customers starting with letters b,s,p
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE '[bsp]%';

// all customers starting with letters a,b,c
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE '[a-c]%';

// all customers not starging with letters b,s,p
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE '[!bsp]%';

// similar query but with like
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City NOT LIKE '[bsp]%';
```

## IN operator
The IN operator allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause.
The IN operator is a shorthand for multiple OR conditions.

IN Syntax
```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...);

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IN (SELECT STATEMENT);
```

Examples
```sql
// all customers located in Germany, France or UK
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country IN ('Germany', 'France', 'UK');

// same above but not in Germany, France, UK
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country NOT IN ('Germany', 'France', 'UK');

// Select all customers from contries which are suppliers
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country IN (SELECT Country FROM Suppliers);
```

## Between Clause
The BETWEEN operator selects values within a given range. The values can be numbers, text, or dates.
The BETWEEN operator is inclusive: begin and end values are included. 

Between Syntax:
```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;
```

Examples
```sql
SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE Price BETWEEN 10 AND 20;

// Using not
SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE Price NOT BETWEEN 10 AND 20;

// With In Clause
// The following SQL statement selects all products with a price 
// between 10 and 20. In addition; do not show products with
// a CategoryID of 1,2, or 3
SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE Price BETWEEN 10 AND 20
AND CategoryID NOT IN (1,2,3);

// Text values
SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE ProductName BETWEEN 'Carnarvon Tigers' AND 'Mozzarella di Giovanni'
ORDER BY ProductName;

SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE ProductName BETWEEN "Carnarvon Tigers" AND "Chef Anton's Cajun Seasoning"
ORDER BY ProductName;

// Not between
SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE ProductName NOT BETWEEN 'Carnarvon Tigers' AND 'Mozzarella di Giovanni'
ORDER BY ProductName;
```

Demo Database Examples
```sql
// Date example
SELECT * FROM Orders
WHERE OrderDate BETWEEN #07/01/1996# AND #07/31/1996#;

// Better way that the one above
SELECT * FROM Orders
WHERE OrderDate BETWEEN '1996-07-01' AND '1996-07-31';
```

## SQL Alias
SQL aliases are used to give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name.
Aliases are often used to make column names more readable.
An alias only exists for the duration of that query.
An alias is created with the AS keyword.

Column Syntax:
```sql
SELECT column_name AS alias_name
FROM table_name;
```

Table Syntax:
```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name AS alias_name;
```

Alias for Column examples:
```sql
// The following SQL statement creates two aliases, one for the CustomerID 
// column and one for the CustomerName column
SELECT CustomerID AS ID, CustomerName AS Customer
FROM Customers;

// The following SQL statement creates two aliases, 
// one for the CustomerName column and one for the ContactName column. 
// Note: It requires double quotation marks or square brackets if the 
// alias name contains spaces:
SELECT CustomerName AS Customer, ContactName AS [Contact Person]
FROM Customers;

// The following SQL statement creates an alias named 
// "Address" that combine four columns (Address, PostalCode, City and Country):
SELECT CustomerName, Address + ', ' + PostalCode + ' ' + City + ', ' + Country AS Address
FROM Customers;

// The same query to work in mysql
SELECT CustomerName, CONCAT(Address,', ',PostalCode,', ',City,', ',Country) AS Address
FROM Customers;

// Same query in Oracle
SELECT CustomerName, (Address || ', ' || PostalCode || ' ' || City || ', ' || Country) AS Address
FROM Customers;
```

Alias for Table Names:
```sql
// The following SQL statement selects all the orders 
// from the customer with CustomerID=4 (Around the Horn). 
// We use the "Customers" and "Orders" tables, and give them 
// the table aliases of "c" and "o" respectively 
// (Here we use aliases to make the SQL shorter)
SELECT o.OrderID, o.OrderDate, c.CustomerName
FROM Customers AS c, Orders AS o
WHERE c.CustomerName='Around the Horn' AND c.CustomerID=o.CustomerID;

// The following SQL statement is the same as above, but without aliases:
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Orders.OrderDate, Customers.CustomerName
FROM Customers, Orders
WHERE Customers.CustomerName='Around the Horn' AND Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID;
```

Aliases can be useful when:
- There are more than one table involved in a query
- Functions are used in the query
- Column names are big or not very readable
- Two or more columns are combined together

## Join Statement
A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them

Example of inner join.
```sql
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderDate
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID;
```

Different Types of SQL JOINs
- (INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
- LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, 
and the matched records from the right table
- RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, 
and the matched records from the left table
- FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match 
in either left or right table


## Inner Join
The INNER JOIN keyword selects records that have matching values in both tables.

INNER JOIN Syntax
```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
```

Examples:
```sql
// The INNER JOIN keyword selects all rows from both tables as long 
// as there is a match between the columns. 
// If there are records in the "Orders" table that do not 
// have matches in "Customers", these orders will not be shown!
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;
```

JOIN Three Tables
```sql
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Shippers.ShipperName
FROM (
    (Orders INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID)
    INNER JOIN Shippers ON Orders.ShipperID = Shippers.ShipperID);
```

## Left Join
The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all records from the left table (table1), 
and the matching records from the right table (table2). 
The result is 0 records from the right side, if there is no match.

Left join syntax:
```sql
// In some databases LEFT JOIN is called LEFT OUTER JOIN.
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
```

Left Join Example:
```sql
// Note: The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all records from the left table 
// (Customers), even if there are no matches in the right table (Orders).
SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID
ORDER BY Customers.CustomerName;
```

## Right Join
The RIGHT JOIN keyword returns all records from the right table (table2), 
and the matching records from the left table (table1). 
The result is 0 records from the left side, if there is no match.

Right Join Syntax:
```sql
// Note: In some databases RIGHT JOIN is called RIGHT OUTER JOIN.
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
```

SQL Right Join Example:
```sql
// Note: The RIGHT JOIN keyword returns all records from the 
// right table (Employees), even if there are no matches in the 
// left table (Orders).
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Employees.LastName, Employees.FirstName
FROM Orders
RIGHT JOIN Employees ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID
ORDER BY Orders.OrderID;
```

## Full Join
The FULL OUTER JOIN keyword returns all records when there is a 
match in left (table1) or right (table2) table records.
FULL OUTER JOIN and FULL JOIN are the same.

FULL OUTER JOIN Syntax
```sql
// FULL OUTER JOIN can potentially return very large result-sets!
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name
WHERE condition;
```

Full Outer Join sets syntax:
```sql
// The FULL OUTER JOIN keyword returns all matching records 
// from both tables whether the other table matches or not. 
// So, if there are rows in "Customers" that do not have matches in "Orders",
// or if there are rows in "Orders" that do not have matches in "Customers", 
// those rows will be listed as well.
SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
FROM Customers
FULL OUTER JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID
ORDER BY Customers.CustomerName;
```

## Self Join
A self join is a regular join, but the table is joined with itself.

Self Join Syntax
```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1 T1, table1 T2
WHERE condition;
```
T1 and T2 are different table aliases for the same table.

SQL Self Join Examples:
```sql
// The following SQL statement matches customers that are from the same city
SELECT A.CustomerName AS CustomerName1, B.CustomerName AS CustomerName2, 
       A.City
FROM Customers A, Customers B
WHERE A.CustomerID <> B.CustomerID
AND A.City = B.City
ORDER BY A.City;
```

## SQL Union
The UNION operator is used to combine the result-set of two or
more SELECT statements.
- Every SELECT statement within UNION must have the same number of columns
- The columns must also have similar data types
- The columns in every SELECT statement must also be in the same order

Union Syntax:
```sql
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;
```

UNION ALL Syntax
The UNION operator selects only distinct values by default. To allow duplicate values, use UNION ALL:
```sql
// The column names in the result-set are usually equal to the column names in the first SELECT statement.
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
UNION ALL
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;
```

SQL Union Example
```sql
// The following SQL statement returns the cities 
// (only distinct values) from both the "Customers" and the "Suppliers" 
// table
SELECT City FROM Customers
UNION
SELECT City FROM Suppliers
ORDER BY City;

// Note: If some customers or suppliers have the same city, 
// each city will only be listed once, because UNION selects 
// only distinct values. Use UNION ALL to also select duplicate values!

// The following SQL statement returns the cities 
// (duplicate values also) from both the "Customers" 
// and the "Suppliers" table
SELECT City FROM Customers
UNION ALL
SELECT City FROM Suppliers
ORDER BY City;
```

SQL UNION With WHERE
```sql
// The following SQL statement returns the German cities 
// (only distinct values) from both the "Customers" and the "Suppliers" table
SELECT City, Country FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany'
UNION
SELECT City, Country FROM Suppliers
WHERE Country='Germany'
ORDER BY City;
```

SQL UNION ALL With WHERE
```sql
// The following SQL statement returns the German cities 
// (duplicate values also) from both the "Customers" and the "Suppliers" table
SELECT City, Country FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany'
UNION ALL
SELECT City, Country FROM Suppliers
WHERE Country='Germany'
ORDER BY City;

// The following SQL statement lists all customers and suppliers
SELECT 'Customer' AS Type, ContactName, City, Country
FROM Customers
UNION
SELECT 'Supplier', ContactName, City, Country
FROM Suppliers;
```

## Group By
The GROUP BY statement groups rows that have the same values into 
summary rows, like "find the number of customers in each country".
The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions 
(COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM(), AVG()) to group the result-set by 
one or more columns.

GROUP BY Syntax
```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name(s)
ORDER BY column_name(s);
```

Examples:
```sql
// The following SQL statement lists the number of customers in each country
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country;

// The following SQL statement lists the number of customers 
// in each country, sorted high to low
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country
ORDER BY COUNT(CustomerID) DESC;
```

Group by with join example:
```sql
// lists the number of orders sent by each shipper
select shippers.shippername, 
count(orders.orderid) as numberoforders 
from orders
left join shippers 
on orders.shipperid = shippers.shipperid
group by shippername;
```


## HAVING Clause
Having clause was added to sql because the where keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions.

Syntax
```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name(s)
HAVING condition
ORDER BY column_name(s);
```

The following SQL statement lists the number of customers in each country. Only include countries with more than 5 customers:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country
HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) > 5;
```

The following SQL statement lists the number of customers in each country, sorted high to low (Only include countries with more than 5 customers):
```sql
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country
HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) > 5
ORDER BY COUNT(CustomerID) DESC;
```

The following SQL statement lists the employees that have registered more than 10 orders:
```sql
SELECT Employees.LastName, COUNT(Orders.OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders
FROM (Orders
INNER JOIN Employees ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID)
GROUP BY LastName
HAVING COUNT(Orders.OrderID) > 10;
```

The following SQL statement lists if the employees "Davolio" or "Fuller" have registered more than 25 orders
```sql
SELECT Employees.LastName, COUNT(Orders.OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Employees ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID
WHERE LastName = 'Davolio' OR LastName = 'Fuller'
GROUP BY LastName
HAVING COUNT(Orders.OrderID) > 25;
```
