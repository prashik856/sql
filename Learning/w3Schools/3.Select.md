# Select Statement

Used to select data from a database
```sql
select * from Customers;
```

## Syntax
```sql
select column1, colum2, ... from table_name;
```
columns are filed names.
If we want all fields

```sql
select * from table_name;
```

## Select Column
```sql
select customername, city from customers;
select * from customers;
```

## Distinct statement
Return only distinct (different) values.
```sql
select distinct column1, column2, ... from table_name;
select Country from Customers;
select distinct country from customers;
```

## Distinct Count
```sql
select count(distinct Country) from customers;
/*
The above query might not work in Microsoft access db.
*/
select count(*) as distincyCountries from ( select distinct Country from Customers);
```

## Where Clause
Where clause is used to filter records.
```sql
select column1, column2, ...
from table_name
where condition;
```
Where clause is also used in Update and Delete, etc.

```sql
select * from customers where country='Mexico';
```
For text vs numeric fields
```sql
select * from customers where customerid=1;
```

Operators in where clause
```sql
/*
= Equal
> Greater than
< Less than
>= Greater than or equal
<= Less than or equal
<> Not equal. In some versions, we have != as not equal
between - between a certain range
like - search for pattern
in - to specify multiple possible values for a column
*/
```

## AND, OR and NOT Operators
Where clause can be combined with AND, OR and NOT Operators.
AND - all are true
OR - any one of them is true
NOT - not true

And syntax
```sql
select column1, column2, ...
from table_name
where condition1 and condition2 and condition3 ...;
```

OR syntax
```sql
select column1, column2, ...
from table_name
where condition1 or condition2 or condition3 ...;
```

Not syntax
```sql
select column1, column2, ...
from table_name
where not condition;
```

Examples:
```sql
select * from customers 
where country='Germany' AND City='Berlin';

select * from Customers where City='Berlin' or City='Munchen';

select * from Customers where Country='Germany' or Country='Spain';

select * from customers where not country='Germany';
```

Combining and, or and not
```sql
select * from customers 
where country='Germany' and 
      (City='Berlin' or city='Muchen');

select * from customers 
         where not country='Germany' 
           and not country='usa';
```

## Order keyword
order by is used to sort the result-set.
desc keyword is used for decending and asc is used for ascending order.

```sql
select column1, column2, ...
from table_name
order by column1, column2, ...
ASC|DESC;
```

Order by example
```sql
select * from customers order by country;

select * from customers order by country desc;
```

Order by several columns. First column takes preference.
```sql
select * from customers
order by country, customername;
```

Sorted ascending by country, and descending by customername
```sql
select * from customers
order by country asc, customername desc;
```

## Null values
Null values ia field with no value.
How to test null values? We use these

is null syntax
```sql
select column_names 
from table_name
where column_name is null;
```

is not null syntax
```sql
select column_names
from table_name
where column_name is not null;
```

The is null Operator. Used to test for empty values (null values)
```sql
select customername, contactname, address 
from customers 
where address is null;
```
Always use is null to look for null values.

The is no null operator, used to test for non-empty values.
```sql
select customername, contactname, address
from customers 
where address is not null;
```

## TOP, LIMIT, FETCH FIRST OR ROWNUM Clause
select top clause is used to specify the number of records to return.
Useful in large tables with thousands of records.

Not all databases supports *select top* clause.
Mysql supports limit clause.
Oracle uses *Fetch First n rows only* and *Rownum*

SQL Server/MS Access Syntax:
```sql
select top number|percent
column_name(s)
from table_name
where condition;
```

MySQL Syntax:
```sql
select column_names(s)
from table_name
where condition
limit number;
```

Oracle 12 Syntax:
```sql
select column_name(s)
from table_name
order by column_name(s)
fetch first number rows only;
```

Older Oracle Syntax
```sql
select column_name(s)
from table_name
where rownum <= number;
```

Older Oracle Syntax (with Order by)
```sql
from (select column_name(s) 
    from table_name order by column_name(s))
where rownum <= number;
```

Examples
```sql
select top 3 * from customers;

// mysql equivalent
select * from customers limit 3;

// Oracle equivalent
select * from customers fetch first 3 rows only;
```

Top percent example. for sql server/ms access
```sql
select top 50 percent * from customers;

// Oracle
select * from customers fetch first 50 percent rows only;
```

Add a where clause
```sql
select top 3 * from customers where country='Germany';

// mysql equivalent
select * from customers where country='Germany' limit 3;

// Oracle
select * from customers where country = 'Germany'
fetch first 3 rows only;
```
